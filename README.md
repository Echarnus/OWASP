# OWASP
Bit of documentation/ testing for OWASP for .Net/ Kubernetes related projects.

## What is OWASP

**O**pen **W**eb **A**pplication **S**ecurity **P**roject is a community which brings out a set of guidelines during each stage of a project to make an application as secure as possible. It shares knowledge about vulnerabilities from the past to avoid to make the same mistakes. This includes practices such as CORS, CSRF, (SQL) injection, misconfiguration and so on. 

## The rules of OWASP

Each year the OWASP community creates the 'top ten' to show which vulnarabilities were most popular during that year. Whereas SQL injection vulnarabilities used to be common, awareness made these kind of vulnarabilities have dropped down in the list.
